# Car Store Front End

This repository contains code for a Pretend Retail Car Site that was made as a project during my tenue at Souther Careers Institue.
It features embedded videos, pictures, and uses jquery as well as bootstrap 4 in order to complete the project design requirements

It is designed to run on the frontend (in a browser) with no additional downloads necessary. Simply download/clone this reposiitory and open the index file in your favorite browser.

Enjoy!!
